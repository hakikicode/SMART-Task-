# SMART Task Description:

# Task Name:
SMART Task
A Game Data Aggregator and Validator

# Description:
This Smart Task fetches game data from smartclick game, submitted games and multiple public endpoints, including APIs and web-scraped content, to validate and store aggregated data in the Koii network. The task is designed to crawl a set of pre-defined public APIs and websites that provide gaming statistics, leaderboards, or player performance data. The aggregated data is then stored in the decentralized namespace to ensure it is available for audit and reward distribution based on defined performance criteria.

The Smart Task follows these key steps:

    Data Crawling & Fetching: The task fetches data from multiple sources, combining game-related data like game scores, player rankings, and other metrics.
    Validation: Data fetched from each source is validated for accuracy and consistency using predefined rules and criteria.
    Storage: Once validated, the data is stored in the Koii namespace storage to ensure it can be referenced for future auditing and task rewards.
    Audit Submission: In each task round, a submission is made to the Koii network summarizing the validated game data to be reviewed and audited by other nodes.

This task ensures that psubmitted and ublicly available gaming data is properly crawled, verified, and utilized in a decentralized manner, while also offering a reward mechanism for nodes participating in the validation process.
